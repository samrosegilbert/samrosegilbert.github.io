While we all know that 3D models come into their own when there are spatial asymmetries or synchronous rotation, it’s important to consider how detectable the modeled phenomenon is to upcoming telescopes. Complementing 3D, 1D is well-suited to near-term transmission observations and will have a valuable role to play in retrieval of atmospheric information from upcoming observations of terrestrial planets.","tags":["talks"],"title":"Developing a hierarchy of models for terrestrial habitability studies","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1571430937,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571430937,"objectID":"70d326d8282532d765881e449d1cb904","permalink":"/project/fridayharbor/","publishdate":"2019-10-18T16:35:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/fridayharbor/","section":"project","summary":"As part of the annual Astrobiology workshop at the University of Washington, my fellow grad students and I journeyed to Friday Harbor Labs to board the Rachel Carson, a UW oceanographic research vessel in fall 2019.

We then dissected our invertebrates in the laboratory to discuss the growing complexity demonstratedby lifeforms like bivalves, prawns, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins.","tags":["fieldwork"],"title":"Trawling the Puget Sound to Trace the Evolutionary History of Invertebrate Organisms","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569459600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569459600,"objectID":"5111355fb9f43887f0c11bd673fb1e2e","permalink":"/talk/astroontap/","publishdate":"2020-07-09T16:49:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/astroontap/","section":"talk","summary":"Using Brian Keating's 2018 book Losing the Nobel Prize as a primary text, I analyzed the infamous story of the BICEP science team in their search for proof of the universe's anistropy. While the scientific community deemed their efforts a great failure, I found an important human story underlying the team's trials: we do our best work when we truly work together towards a common goal. Conversely, when we operate in an environment built on the fear of failure and its consequences, we suffer academically and more importantly, we suffer personally.","tags":["talks"],"title":"Leaving the Competition in the Dust: A CMB Case Study","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1567800710,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567800710,"objectID":"5aadfc551df694f6a36944a6a04ec759","permalink":"/project/yellowstone/","publishdate":"2019-09-06T16:11:50-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/yellowstone/","section":"project","summary":"Under the supervision of Dr. Niki Parenteau (NASA Ames) and with federal permits, I used a mobile spectrometer to measure the reflectivity of different microbial mats in the acidic environments of the Yellowstone hot springs in summer 2019.
